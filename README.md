# DS18B20-Temperature-Sensor-Rust
Rust Embedded application for reading temperature from a DS18B20 sensor, designed to run on both host systems and Cortex-M microcontrollers.

This repository is a hands-on invitation to the brave new world of Embedded Systems development leveraging the rustacean landscape. 

1. **'Fearless Concurrency' in Embedded Systems**: Rust's emphasis on zero-cost abstractions, safety, and fearless concurrency makes it an enticing alternative to traditional embedded languages like C and C++. This repository provides fledgling rustaceans a launchpad into the embedded system's milieu.

2. **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) Deep Dive**: The repository masterfully exemplifies the design and implementation of a HAL, which is an essential piece of the embedded systems puzzle. The HAL interface helps in writing a reusable and hardware-agnostic higher-level application code.

3. **Cross-compilation Flex**: In the world of embedded systems, cross-compilation is the name of the game. The example in the repository provides a lucid illustration of setting up a rust project encompassing the intricacies of cross-compilation.

4. **Conditional Compilation Magic**: The repository also gives a sneak peek into the awesomeness of conditional compilation in Rust. Using Rust's cfg attribute and Cargo features, it shows how to switch between different features at compile time - truly a boon when you're targeting different environments!

5. **Sensor Interaction Basics**: Though the code mimics a hypothetical interaction with a real-world DS18B20 sensor, it opens up a cosmos of possibilities for real sensor interaction in myriad embedded applications.

In a nutshell, dig into this repository, decode the enigma of embedded systems through the rustacean lens and expand your understanding with each line of code!
